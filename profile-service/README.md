### Purpose

The group service is designed to create, update, and delete data relating to each group.

### Use Cases

1. Create a group, update an artist profile, and delete a group.
2. Fetch tracks and albums of a group.
3. Fetch artist followers, members, and favorite artists of a group.

### Current State

Currently the group service has basic scaffolding functions, still needs updating and refactoring.
